% Question 5

The advantages of a very flexible approach for regression or classification 
include accuracy if over-fitting has not been exhibited, while the disadvantages 
include interpretability, large variance in errors, and tendency for over-fitting to
occur. A more flexible approach might be preferred when a set of data contains
a large variation in the response and a less flexible approach would be 
preferable if the data tends to contain few outliers.\par
