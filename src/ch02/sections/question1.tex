% Question 1

\begin{itemize}
    \item[(a)] Given a very large sample size $n$ and a small number of predictors 
    $p$, an inflexible method would be better than a flexible one, since the risk of
    overfitting is less.
    \item[(b)] For the same reasons as (a), a flexible method would yield better 
    results for small $n$ and large $p$.
    \item[(c)] A flexible method would yield better results, since non-linear
    functions cannot be accurately modelled by linear functions.
    \item[(d)] If there is high variance in the error terms, an inflexible method
    would be better, since a flexible method would introduce even more variance
    in the values of $\hat{f}$.
\end{itemize}
