% Question 4

\begin{itemize}
    \item[(a)] Three real-life applications in which classification might be useful
    include: 
    \begin{itemize}
        \item[(i)] Determining a voter's party preference based upon the results of 
        a census. The response would be a classification of a voter as being likely 
        to vote for one of the possible political parties and the predictors would be 
        features such as age, demographic, or location, which could be quantitative
        or qualitative. The goal in this case would be prediction, since we would 
        most likely want to determine their vote in the next election.
        \item[(ii)]
