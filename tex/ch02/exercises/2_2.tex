% Exercise 2.2

\begin{itemize}
    \item[(a)] This is a classification problem, since we are trying to identify
    a qualitative trend in the data. It is an inference problem, since we are not
    trying to estimate future values of $f$. In this case, we have $n = 500$ and
    $p = 4$.
    \item[(b)] This is a classification problem, since we are trying to classify 
    the product as either a success or a failure. It is also a prediction problem,
    since we are looking to estimate a future output. We have $n = 20$ and $p = 14$.
    \item[(c)] This is a regression problem since we have quantitative data and
    assume that it fits some function $f$, which we are attempting to estimate. 
    Since this is a future estimate, it is a prediction problem. We have $n = 52$ 
    and $p = 4$.
\end{itemize}
