Boston Data

Description:

     A data set containing housing values in 506 suburbs of Boston.

Usage:

     Boston

Format:

     A data frame with 506 rows and 13 variables.

     ‘crim’ per capita crime rate by town.

     ‘zn’ proportion of residential land zoned for lots over 25,000
          sq.ft.

     ‘indus’ proportion of non-retail business acres per town.

     ‘chas’ Charles River dummy variable (= 1 if tract bounds river; 0
          otherwise).

     ‘nox’ nitrogen oxides concentration (parts per 10 million).

     ‘rm’ average number of rooms per dwelling.

     ‘age’ proportion of owner-occupied units built prior to 1940.

     ‘dis’ weighted mean of distances to five Boston employment
          centres.

     ‘rad’ index of accessibility to radial highways.

     ‘tax’ full-value property-tax rate per $10,000.

     ‘ptratio’ pupil-teacher ratio by town.

     ‘lstat’ lower status of the population (percent).

     ‘medv’ median value of owner-occupied homes in $1000s.
    \end{verbatim}\normalsize
\item[(b)] In Figure~\ref{fig7}, we have some of the data from the \verb|Boston| data
    set displayed in scatterplots.\par
    \begin{figure}[!ht]
        \includegraphics[width=\textwidth, center]{../plots/ex2_10_b.pdf}
        \caption{Scatterplots of Boston data \label{fig7}}
    \end{figure}
    \qquad From the scatterplots in this figure, we may see that as the distance to 
    employment centres increases, the nitrogen oxide concentration decreases,
    perhaps indicating higher levels of nitrogen oxide in the inner city due
    to vehicles and industrial pollution, which coincides with where employment
    centres are located. Likewise, we see that owner-occupied units built prior
    to the year 1940 are concentrated in the city centre.\par
    \qquad We also see that a higher number of rooms and value of owner-occupied 
    homes tend to be concentrated amongst the lower status of the population.
    \item[(c)] We can see that per capita crime rates are correlated with the
    lower status of the population by looking at Figure~\ref{fig8}.
    \begin{figure}[!ht]
        \includegraphics[width=\textwidth, center]{../plots/ex2_10_c.pdf}
        \caption{Scatterplot of crim vs lstat data \label{fig8}}
    \end{figure}
    It appears that high per capita crime rates are associated with a 
    larger population in the lower status category.
    \item[(d)] Yes, we have the following summary:
    \scriptsize\begin{verbatim}
> summary(Boston$crim)
    Min.  1st Qu.   Median     Mean  3rd Qu.     Max.
 0.00632  0.08204  0.25651  3.61352  3.67708 88.97620
    \end{verbatim}\normalsize
    While the median and mean for the \verb|crim| data are 
    0.25651 and 3.61352, respectively, the range is $[0.00632, 88.97620]$,
    so that some census tracts must have particularly high crime rates.
    Tax rates appear to be more evenly distributed, as can be seen from the
    following:
    \scriptsize\begin{verbatim}
> summary(Boston$tax)
   Min. 1st Qu.  Median    Mean 3rd Qu.    Max.
  187.0   279.0   330.0   408.2   666.0   711.0
    \end{verbatim}\normalsize
    The same applies to pupil-teacher ratios:
    \scriptsize\begin{verbatim}
> summary(Boston$ptratio)
   Min. 1st Qu.  Median    Mean 3rd Qu.    Max.
  12.60   17.40   19.05   18.46   20.20   22.00
    \end{verbatim}\normalsize
    \item[(e)]
    We have the following:
    \scriptsize\begin{verbatim}
> sum(Boston$chas)
[1] 35
    \end{verbatim}\normalsize
    \item[(f)]
    We have the following:
    \scriptsize\begin{verbatim}
> median(Boston$ptratio)
[1] 19.05
    \end{verbatim}\normalsize
    \item[(g)]
    The tract corresponding to observation $i = 399$, for which we have
    \scriptsize\begin{verbatim}
> median(Boston$ptratio)
[1] 19.05
    \end{verbatim}\normalsize
    For that census tract, we have the following data:
    \scriptsize\begin{verbatim}
> Boston[399,]
       crim zn indus chas   nox    rm age    dis rad tax ptratio lstat medv
399 38.3518  0  18.1    0 0.693 5.453 100 1.4896  24 666    20.2 30.59    5
    \end{verbatim}\normalsize
    We can see that the \verb|crim| variable is far higher than the median 
    value of 3.61352, and is also in the higher range for the variables
    \verb|tax| and \verb|ptratio| for which the range was determined in (d).
    This would likely indicate a correlation between these variables.
    \item[(h)]
    We have the following code to find the number of census tracts which
    average more than 7 and 8 rooms per dwelling:
    \scriptsize\begin{verbatim}
> sum(Boston$rm > 7)
[1] 64
> sum(Boston$rm > 8)
[1] 13
    \end{verbatim}\normalsize
    We have the following summary of all census tracts averaging more than 8
    rooms:
    \scriptsize\begin{verbatim}
> summary(Boston[Boston$rm > 8, ])

    \end{verbatim}\normalsize
    From the above summary, it becomes clear that census tracts with a large 
    average number of rooms per dwelling have correspondingly low crime rates,
    relatively high tax rates, and relatively high pupil-teacher ratios.
