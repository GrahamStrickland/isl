% Exercise 3.6

From (3.4), we have
\[
    \hat{\beta}_0 = \bar{y} - \hat{\beta}_1 \bar{x},
\]
so that we have 
\begin{equation*}
    \begin{split}
        \hat{y}_i(\bar{x}) &= \hat{\beta}_0 + \hat{\beta}_1 \bar{x} \\
                           &= \bar{y} - \hat{\beta}_1 \bar{x} + 
                            \hat{\beta}_1 \bar{x} \\
                           &= \bar{y},
    \end{split}
\end{equation*}
and we conclude that the least squares line passes through the point 
$(\bar{x}, \bar{y})$.
