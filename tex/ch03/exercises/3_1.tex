% Exercise 3.1

The four null hypotheses to which the $p$-values in Table 3.4 correspond are the following:
\begin{itemize}
    \item[$H_{0I}$:]
        There is no relationship between \verb|sales| and $\beta_0$.
    \item[$H_{0T}$:]
        There is no relationship between \verb|sales| and \verb|TV|.
    \item[$H_{0r}$:]
        There is no relationship between \verb|sales| and \verb|radio|.
    \item[$H_{0n}$:]
        There is no relationship between \verb|sales| and \verb|newspaper|.
\end{itemize}
The $p$-values for $H_{0I}$, $H_{0T}$, and $H_{0r}$ are all below 0.0001, so that we can 
reject the null hypothesis in these four cases, and we can conclude that there do exist
relationships between \verb|sales|, $\beta_0$, \verb|TV|, and \verb|radio|. Since the
$p$-value of a regression of \verb|sales| on \verb|newspaper| is relatively large, 
$p = 0.8599$, we can conclude that it is unlikely that \verb|newspaper| alone will have
an effect upon \verb|sales|.
