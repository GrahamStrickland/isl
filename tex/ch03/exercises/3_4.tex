% Exercise 3.4

\begin{itemize}
    \item[(a)]
        In both cases, the training RSS will be the same, since the least squares
        model uses the best linear approximation to the true relationship between
        $X$ and $Y$.
    \item[(b)]
        The test RSS will be greater for the cubic regression, since it does not
        model the real relationship between $X$ and $Y$ as well as the linear
        regression.
    \item[(c)]
        The answer is the same as (a), since the training RSS will be minimised
        by the choice of any linear regression approach.
    \item[(d)]
        There is not enough information, since we do not know which model more
        closely matches the non-linear relationship between $X$ and $Y$.
\end{itemize}
